When shall we three meet again? In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

I come, Graymalkin.
Where hast thou been, sister?
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap And munched and munched and munched. "Give me," quoth I. "Aroint thee, witch," the rump-fed runnion cries. Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' th' Tiger; But in a sieve I'll thither sail, And, like a rat without a tail, I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.

I myself have all the other, And the very ports they blow; All the quarters that they know I' th' shipman's card. I'll drain him dry as hay.
